  "Sobre": "Hello, I have a degree in Multimedia Production. I worked in the 3D field, but I recently transitioned my career and am now focused on developing Frontend and Backend systems. \n I'm proficient in Python, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript, with experience using libraries such as Bootstrap, JQuery, ESLint, React, Redux, Next.js, and Vue.js. I also have solid knowledge of Node.js modules, including Sass, Less, Grunt, Gulp, Uglify, and Parcel. I apply the Ajax methodology for API integration and perform software testing to ensure reliability and functionality, using tools such as Jest and Cypress. \n As I mentioned, I previously worked as a 3D modeler and have skills in Maya, V-Ray, Xgen, ZBrush, Blender, Unreal Engine, Marmoset Toolbag, Photoshop, Marvelous, and Substance Painter. \n As you can see, I have always been passionate about technology—I love exploring new technologies, and one of my hobbies is building computers with the best components available on the market. \n I enjoy working in teams, as collaborating with more experienced professionals helps me grow and contributes to my career development. I continuously study and practice to improve my skills. I have international experience and am open to working abroad. Check out my projects below.",
